  <h1>The Mona Lisa Italian: Monna Lisa or 
    La Gioconda French:La Joconde is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. 
    Considered an archetypal masterpiece of 
    the Italian Renaissance,it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, 
    the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world"
    The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression,
    the monumentality of the composition,the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric 
    illusionism.[8]The painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini,
    the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. 
    It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may 
    have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property 
    of the French Republic itself, on permanent display at the Louvre, Paris since 1797.The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable 
    paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation 
    in history at US$100 million in 1962[11] (equivalent to $660 million in 2019)</h1>
